# Pitt Soccer Analytics App

# We should probably get rid of the Variable data types part of the upload JSON page

Welcome! 

This app is designed to provide insight about collegiate soccer through the use of visual plots and tables that summarize key statistics.

## How to use the App

### Uploading Data
First the app needs data to analyze. To upload data:
1. Navigate to the tab labelled **Upload JSON** in the top row.
2. Click on the box labelled **Browse...** on the lefthand side of the page
3. Select the Wayscout Event level data JSON file that contains the game(s) that you would like to analyze.
4. There should be a blue bar under the **Browse...** button that says "Upload complete", along with information in the "Games in upload" section on the right; If so, that indicates that the data has been successfully uploaded into the app.

With the data uploaded now you can use the other tabs in the top row of the app to view the data in different ways.
